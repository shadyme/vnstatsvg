1. Introduction

    vnStat SVG frontend(vnStatsvg)[1] is another web-based graphical frontend
    to vnStat(a network traffic monitor for Linux)[2]. it is suited to the
    distributed & embedded system built on linux.

    it is based on HTML, XML, XSL, Javascript, CSS, SVG, for more information,
    please read the PAPER[5](this is a paper I have published in "The First
    IEEE International Conference on Ubi-media Computing").

    if you have interest, you can try to use another web-based vnStat
    frontendp[3] and compare it with vnStatSVG, and then try to understand why
    vnStatSVG is more suited to distributed & embedded system.
