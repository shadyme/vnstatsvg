    vnStatSVG is a lightweight AJAX based web front-end for network monitoring.

    To use it, its backend http://humdi.net/vnstat/ must be installed at first.

    It only requires a CGI-supported http server but also generates a graphical
    report with SVG. Compare to the other counterparts, it has such features:

	o It generates graphic output dynamically with SVG and AJAX
	o It not only works with Apache but also works with Busybox httpd and
	without any other specific requirement but only the cgi-bin support.
	o It supports to monitor multi-interfaces and multi-hosts in 'one' window
