	HERE is a list of the jobs will todo in future. if you have any new
	ideas, WELCOME to write down.

-----------

1. support Authentication, SNMP? what else?
2. abstract a monitoring Framework
3. Replace the httpclient with a more common wget like tools to support more protocols
   Example:
   $ wget -c "http://tinylab.org/cgi-bin/vnstat.sh?i=eth0&p=summary" -O tinylab.org.eth0.summary.xml
   This allows to put the data into a ftp, http.
   Or we'd better let it support the other protocols, like ssh with scp tools.
4. Improve the vnstatgui and make the whole vnstatSVG be accessed from browsers without http server
   Firstly, allow to get XML data from the other hosts without http server, for example, support ssh, ftp...
   Second, allow to get local data with the file:// protocol without local http server.
